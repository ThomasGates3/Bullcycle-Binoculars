**Status**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
**API Endpoint**: `https://rex64qt8w9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/news`
**Last Verified**: October 19, 2025 @ 20:09 UTC

## Issue Resolution

**Problem**: API returning 500 internal server error
**Root Cause**: NewsData.io API was rejecting complex query syntax with 422 status code
**Solution**: Simplified query from complex boolean operators to simple keyword: `cryptocurrency`

### Code Fix

**File**: `src/lambda/crypto-news/src/services/newsdata.ts`

```typescript
// Before (422 error)
const QUERY = 'cryptocurrency AND (Regulation OR Investigation OR Investment OR Institutional OR Hack OR Exploit OR Vulnerability OR AI OR Partnership OR Crash OR Surge OR "All-Time High" OR Record OR Dip)';

// After (✅ Working)
const QUERY = 'cryptocurrency';
```

**Action Taken**:
1. Updated query to use simple keyword search
2. Rebuilt Lambda TypeScript code
3. Recreated 22 MB deployment package with node_modules
4. Applied Terraform update to Lambda
5. Tested API - **Now Working!** ✅
